                            <p>JobGet is a job search organizer and tracking tool. JobGet helps you organize your job search so that you can secure your dream job quickly and efficiently.</p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li class="box-section js-click-to-expand">How do I use JobGet?
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>To use JobGet, start by entering a new job lead or application by clicking "New Lead" in the navigation menu.</p>
                            <p>Fill in the information you have about the position, company, application, interview, and other notes.</p>
                            <p>It is not necessary to fill in all the information when you first create a lead. For example, you may want to add a new or qualified lead for which you have not yet been invited for an interview. Simply leave the interview information blank until an interview has been scheduled.</p>
                            <p>Select a funnel stage where you'd like to place your job lead.</p>
                            <p>As you move further along the process with any given job lead or application, update JobGet to reflect this progress by changing the lead's funnel stage.</p>
                            <p>You can also include notes to yourself and assign each job lead an overall desirability rating. This information is not required but helps you to keep your thoughts and opinions about each potential job organized in one place.</p>
                            <p>Ideally, your JobGet home page should look something like a funnel shape, with a large number of new and qualified leads, a smaller number of jobs for which you have applied, a smaller number for which you have been invited to interview, and an even smaller number for which you have received offers or are negotiating salary and benefits.</p>

                    </li>
                    <li class="box-section js-click-to-expand">How do I change a lead's funnel stage?
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>To change a lead's funnel stage, click on the lead to open the view details page. From there, click Edit. Click the Funnel Stage dropdown menu and select the new funnel stage. Click Save to update your changes.</p>
                            <p>For example, a lead might move from Interview to Offer once an interview has been conducted and a formal job offer has been made.</p>

                            <p>To edit a lead, simply click on it to view its details, then click "Edit".</p>
                            <p>Make any changes you would like, then click "Save."</p>
                            <p>Your changes will be saved and you will be returned to the home page where you can see an overview of all your leads.</p>
                            <p>Click on the lead again to view the updated information.</p>

                            <p>To delete a lead, simply click on it to view its details, then click "Delete."</p>
                            <p>You will be asked to confirm that you wish to delete the lead.</p>
                            <p>Click "OK" to confirm or "Cancel" to go back without deleting the lead.</p>
                            <p>BE CAREFUL! Once you have deleted a lead, it is not possible to recover that data. Only delete a lead if you are 100% certain you do not want it anymore.</p>

                        <img src="img/filter-icon.svg" alt="A funnel">
                        <p>JobGet was developed from the concept of a job search as a funnel. This idea came from the blog post <a href="https://timsstrategy.com/how-to-create-a-job-search-funnel/" target="_blank">How to Create a Sales Funnel for a Job Search</a> written by Tim Tyrell-Smith. Tim advises job seekers to "manage your prospects like a sales person," referring to the older and well established funnel concept used in sales and marketing.</p>
                        <p>Organizing your job search as a funnel helps you to stay on top of where each job lead or application is in the process. It also lets you see visually whether you need to add more leads at the "top" of the funnel at any given point during your job search.</p>
                        <p>In short, the funnel concept is a very useful tool for finding the job you want as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="box-section js-click-to-expand">What are funnel stages?
                        <p>JobGet uses six funnel stages. These are:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>New Leads: Job leads you haven't vetted or qualified yet.</li>
                            <li>Qualified Leads: Job leads you've looked into to ensure they're still relevant. (For example, the posting has not expired, the job has not been filled, the position is not located in a city you would not move to, etc.).</li>
                            <li>Contact/Apply: Jobs you've already contacted an employer about or submitted an application for.</li>
                            <li>Interview: Jobs where you have reached the interview stage (either called in for an interview or completed an interview).</li>
                            <li>Offer: Jobs you have been formally offered.</li>
                            <li>Negotiate: Jobs you have been offered and are negotiating salary, benefits, work conditions, etc. with the employer.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li class="box-section js-click-to-expand">Who should use JobGet?
                        <p>JobGet is for anyone who is looking for a job. It can be used by job seekers in any field. Whether you are looking for a full-time, part-time, or temporary job, or even an unpaid internship for school or college, JobGet is for you.</p>
